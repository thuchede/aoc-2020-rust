# AOC 2020

## What ?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. I'm attempting to solve all puzzles in rust this year

## Why?
Last year I tried to solve as much as I could to learn about Golang and it was so much fun. 

## Learnings

### Day 1 
- recursion is as fun as always
- Rust does not seem to have tail call optimization
- Option<T> is neat
- Rust's built-in testing seems as nice as Go's
